## Plan for the project/description

- This is the initial project stage to create the skeleton of a React app that will become a full stack React App. The app itself will be a weather app that will tell you based on local weather from a weather Api what clothes you should wear. Some features being used are forms, functional compnents, hooks, and api's. In the form you can add images of different types of clothes and choose what weather those clothes are appropriate for.The clothes will then be added.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
